C++ 11 Spiking Neural Network API
=================================

Dear fellow AI nerd,

Hello! My name is Jose Efrain Aguilar Escamilla and 
this is part of my major robotics project for my 
Intelligent Robotics class. I will be using
this API for spiking neural networks (SNN) to create
a self-organizing network of neurons that can create
a map.

Most of the *Documentation* for this project is incomplete
because I am being quite pressured for time. Once i complete
this project, I will work my best to fine tune and add
efficency boosts to this project allongside a more complete
documentation.

See you after finals!!!
